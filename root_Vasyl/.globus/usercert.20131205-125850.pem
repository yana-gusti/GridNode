The issued certificate should be placed here. The corresponding key file is
  /root/.globus/userkey.20131205-125850.pem

You can always check if your certificate and your private key do correspond to
each other by issuing two commands
  /usr/bin/openssl rsa -in /root/.globus/userkey.20131205-125850.pem -noout -modulus
  /usr/bin/openssl x509 -in <your-certificate> -noout -modulus
and check that their outputs are the same.
